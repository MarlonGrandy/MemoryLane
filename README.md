# MemoryLane

MemoryLane is an iOS app that offers users a space to curate and revisit their most cherished memories. Utilizing the SwiftUI framework, this interactive platform enables users to engage with daily prompts, attach photos, and dive deep into nostalgia.

## The Genesis of MemoryLane
During a drive with my mom through Traverse City, Michigan, we passed by her childhood home â€” a quaint one-story house with a small yard. This brief encounter awakened a sea of memories and emotions in her. She expressed a desire for a space where these memories could be stored and cherished. This moment of reflection was the spark behind MemoryLane.

## Features
- **Memory Capturing**: Daily prompts encourage users to record and reflect on their experiences.
  
- **Custom Themes**: Enhance user experience with themes like "black" and "starry sky."
  
- **Photo Attachments**: Using the iOS 16 PhotosPicker feature, users can seamlessly attach images to their memories.
  
- **Memory Exploration**: Dive into past memories, view them in detail, and share them.

## Getting Started
1. **Prerequisites**: Have Xcode installed, ideally a version that supports iOS 16 or later.
  
2. **Clone & Open**: Clone the MemoryLane repository and open the project in Xcode.
  
3. **Dependencies**: Ensure all dependencies, particularly those linked with Core Data and PhotosUI, are correctly integrated.
  
4. **Run**: Launch the app on your simulator or device of choice.

## Future Work
MemoryLane, in its current state, is not a fully functioning Apple App Store-grade app. However, plans are in motion to enhance its features, improve user experience, and ensure it meets the quality standards expected of top-tier apps. Some anticipated upgrades include:
- Enhanced user interface with intuitive navigation.
- Integration with cloud storage solutions for backup and syncing.
- Advanced customization options for themes and memory presentation.
- Collaborative features allowing users to share and co-create memories.

## Feedback and Contributions
Your feedback is invaluable in making MemoryLane a cherished space for many. Feel free to open issues for suggestions or bugs on GitHub. Contributions to improve the app are also welcomed!
